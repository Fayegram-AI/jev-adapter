# Repository layout

The source repository contains the SDK, CLI, examples, functional tests, CI, and
maintained documentation. The installable npm tarball contains the SDK and CLI
with declarations, examples, and docs; it excludes tests and development scripts.

The `package.json` `files` allowlist defines the npm tarball.
`npm run test:package` verifies the installed files and offline CLI commands. `npm run build`
retains its verified tarball under the ignored `release/` directory. Credentials
belong in local environment files, not in source or package contents.
