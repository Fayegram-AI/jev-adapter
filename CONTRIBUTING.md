# Contributing

## Report an issue or propose a change

Search [existing issues](https://github.com/Fayegram-AI/jev-adapter/issues) before
opening a new one. For a bug, include the adapter version, Node.js version,
operating system, a minimal reproducible request with synthetic data, expected
behavior, and actual behavior. For a feature proposal, describe the use case and
how it fits the provider-independent contract. Report vulnerabilities through the
private route in [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md), not in an issue.

Use a source checkout with Node.js 22.16 or newer. No build step or runtime
dependencies are required. `npm ci --ignore-scripts` checks the dependency-free
lockfile. Type checks additionally need TypeScript; see the
[testing guide](docs/development/TESTING.md).

## Understand the design

Start with the [architecture](docs/development/ARCHITECTURE.md),
[design rationale](docs/development/DESIGN.md), and
[repository layout](docs/development/REPOSITORY_LAYOUT.md).
Preserve the provider-independent `state` / `questions` contract and explicit
probability provenance. Add focused regression tests for bug fixes and wire-level
tests for protocol changes. Fixtures must not contain credentials or live-account
data; label synthetic responses as synthetic.

## Make and verify a change

Work on a focused branch. Use ESM JavaScript, four-space indentation for new code,
LF line endings, and a final newline. Avoid unrelated reformatting of existing
files. Update `.d.mts` declarations and compile-time regressions when public APIs
change. Document user-visible changes in the changelog.

```text
npm run verify
```

Verification includes syntax/JSON/doc-link checks, functional tests, strict public
type contracts, and a clean offline installation of the npm tarball. Coverage is
a separate command. Tests use fixtures and local servers; they do not contact
model accounts. Package checks require npm. Run `npm run test:coverage` when
reviewing coverage; it reruns the same functional suite.

Keep generated files and credentials out of commits. Maintained contributor
documentation belongs in `docs/development/`.

## Review and release

Keep commits focused and explain behavior changes and the checks performed.
Open a pull request with a short description of the behavior change and the
verification you ran; link the relevant issue when one exists.
Inspect `git diff` and `git diff --cached` before committing. Respect existing
authorship and use the project identity configured for the repository.
