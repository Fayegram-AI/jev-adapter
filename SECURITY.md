# Security and operational boundaries

## Credentials and data

Keep keys in the process environment or an explicitly loaded local environment
file. Never place them in request JSON, committed profiles, command-line arguments,
or shared logs. The package contains no key, telemetry client, or background job.
By design it sends the supplied state and question definitions to the selected
provider when evaluation is explicitly requested. Review data-sharing requirements
before sending private repository content or documents.

Built-in constructors do not forward ambient credentials to unrelated custom
origins. The CLI requires explicit credential selection for custom URLs. URL
credentials/query/fragment are rejected; HTTP is limited to loopback and redirects
are not followed. These controls do not authenticate an arbitrary configured host,
resolve all DNS-rebinding risks, or sandbox untrusted URLs. An embedding server
must impose its own allowlist and network controls.

## Safe errors, not a universal secret scanner

HTTP failure bodies/headers and unknown exception stacks are not copied into public
errors. Known keys are removed from request IDs and CLI error string values.
Model outputs, requested labels, state, and arbitrary application logs are not
universally scrubbed. Do not deliberately include secrets in prompts. A custom
provider constructing AdapterError is responsible for a safe message. Never add a
verbose HTTP logger that prints Authorization or x-api-key headers.

## Input and output

Strict plain-JSON checks reject accessors, cycles, non-finite numbers, lossy objects,
and unknown fields. Bytes, nesting, nodes, retries, concurrency, and waiting time
are bounded. These checks do not establish decision accuracy or resist every
adversarial semantic input. Question instructions are trusted configuration;
state is untrusted evidence. Prompt separation is a mitigation, not a guarantee.

Output files use exclusive temporary files and mode 0600 where supported, then
same-directory finalization. Existing output requires explicit --force. Atomicity
and permissions depend on the filesystem/OS; there is no power-loss-proof
transaction across model billing, stdout, and filesystem writes.

## Plugins and cancellation

Custom provider modules execute ordinary trusted JavaScript with process access.
They are not sandboxed and are never auto-discovered. Extensions can perform I/O
and log data by their own design. Honor supplied AbortSignals and close resources;
the adapter can stop awaiting a non-cooperative promise, not terminate arbitrary
code or undo side effects. A provider timeout or cancellation does not prove remote
inference stopped before billing.

## Dependencies and CI

There are zero runtime dependencies. This reduces dependency surface but is not a
security certification. Maintain Node.js security updates. TypeScript is a separate
development tool. The supplied CI uses read-only repository permissions, no model
keys, and no publishing. Review third-party action updates and pin audited action
commits under your organization's policy before using CI in a privileged setting.

## Reporting

For a hosted public repository, use its **Security** tab and **Report a
vulnerability** to submit a private report. The repository owner must enable
private vulnerability reporting when making the repository public, before
announcing the release; this source tree has no dedicated security inbox or other
private contact channel. If the reporting button is absent, ask the maintainer
for a private contact method without
including vulnerability details in a public issue.

Include the affected version, impact, and a minimal redacted reproduction. Do
not publish credentials, confidential inputs, or exploit details in an issue.

## Release assurance

Automated tests and package verification are engineering checks, not an
independent security audit. Consult CI results for the specific commit or
release. Ordinary tests do not establish authenticated vendor
compatibility. See [Testing](docs/development/TESTING.md) for the verification scope.

The input-overwrite guard resolves known path/file aliases; it does not lock the
whole filesystem against concurrent changes. File-output cancellation is honored
until atomic finalization is submitted. It cannot retract an OS operation already
submitted. Parameter objects are validated before inspection/spreading so accessors
are rejected without being invoked by the provider constructors.
